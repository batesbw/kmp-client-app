## To Do ðŸ“‹

This document tracks the specific tasks required to achieve the goals outlined in `PLANNING.md`. It will be updated as the project progresses.

**Date Format for Tasks:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

*   **[X] Task:** Detailed analysis of `frontend` UI components, screens, and navigation flows.
    *   **Date Added:** 2024-07-30
    *   **Sub-tasks:**
        *   **[X]** Identify all major screens in `frontend/src/views` (e.g., `HomeView.vue`, `LibraryAlbums.vue`, `AlbumDetails.vue`, `Search.vue`, `settings/...`).
        *   **[X]** Document navigation paths defined in `frontend/src/layouts/default/BottomNavigation.vue`, `DrawerNavigation.vue`, and overall routing in `App.vue` or router configurations.
        *   **[X]** List reusable UI components from `frontend/src/components` (e.g., `Toolbar.vue`, `ItemsListing.vue`, `MediaItemThumb.vue`, `PlayerCard.vue`, `VolumeControl.vue`). Prioritize by frequency of use and importance.
        *   **[X]** Specifically analyze large components like `ItemsListing.vue` (1199 lines), `QualityDetailsBtn.vue` (1115 lines), `InfoHeader.vue` (494 lines), `LyricsViewer.vue` (585 lines) and `frontend/src/layouts/default/ItemContextMenu.vue` (852 lines) for potential breakdown into smaller Compose functions/files.
        *   **[X]** Analyze `frontend` theming (colors, typography, spacing, iconography) likely defined in `frontend/src/styles/` and `App.vue`.
        *   **[X]** Note any animations or special UI behaviors (e.g., in `Carousel.vue`, `MarqueeText.vue`).
        *   **[X]** Analyze structure of `frontend/src/layouts/default/Default.vue` for overall screen composition.
*   **[X] Task:** Analyze `frontend` interaction with the `server` API.
    *   **Date Added:** 2024-07-30
    *   **Sub-tasks:**
        *   **[X]** Identify key API endpoints called by `frontend` components and views by inspecting their script sections. Focus on interactions with controllers in `server/music_assistant/controllers/` and `server/music_assistant/controllers/media/`.
        *   **[X]** Document data models (request/response structures) for these endpoints.
        *   **[X]** Understand authentication/authorization mechanisms if any (check `main.ts` or API service files in `frontend`).
        *   **[X]** Note any real-time communication aspects (e.g., WebSockets for player status, potentially related to `server/music_assistant/controllers/streams.py` or `players.py`).
*   **[X] Task:** Analyze `server` codebase for relevant API endpoints and data structures.
    *   **Date Added:** 2024-07-30
    *   **Sub-tasks:**
        *   **[X]** Review API endpoint definitions in `server/music_assistant/controllers/music.py`, `players.py`, `player_queues.py`, `streams.py` and files within `server/music_assistant/controllers/media/` (e.g., `albums.py`, `artists.py`, `tracks.py`).
        *   **[X]** Review `server` data models defined in `server/music_assistant/models/` (assuming this path, will verify) or within controllers themselves.
        *   **[X]** Understand how `server/music_assistant/controllers/config.py` exposes settings and how `server/music_assistant/controllers/cache.py` handles caching, to inform Android app equivalents.
*   **[X] Task:** Refine `PLANNING.md` based on detailed analysis (ongoing).
    *   **Date Added:** 2024-07-30
*   **[X] Task:** Populate `TASK.md` with detailed implementation tasks for Phase 2 and beyond (this is an ongoing task for this phase), **prioritizing core player functionality first.**
